# Step 1: Data Loading and Exploration

# Load the historical dataset
df = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/foot_ulcer (alx) - DL/monthly_deaths.csv')  # Replace with your dataset filename

# Display basic information about the dataset
print(df.info())

# Display the first few records of the dataset
print(df.head())

# Step 2: Analysis of the Relationship Between Variables Over Different Periods

# Visualize the relationship between births, deaths, and handwashing over time
sns.set(style="whitegrid")
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

sns.lineplot(x='date', y='deaths', data=df)
plt.title('Deaths Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Deaths')
plt.show()

# Step 3: Calculations to Compare Mortality Rates Before and After Handwashing Implementation

# Calculate average deaths before and after handwashing
avg_deaths_before = df['deaths'].mean()
avg_deaths_before = df['deaths'].mean()

# Step 4: Data Visualizations Illustrating the Impact of Handwashing on Reducing Mortality Rates

# Create a bar plot to compare average deaths before and after handwashing
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))


plt.title('Impact of Handwashing on Deaths')
plt.ylabel('Average Deaths')
plt.show()
